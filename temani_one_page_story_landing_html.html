        <p class="reveal-on-scroll will-change-transform">In old legends, dragons were calm guardians — keepers of
          wisdom who stood watch over important journeys. In the world of Temani, our dragon does not hoard treasures;
          it protects something far more precious: people and their path forward.</p>
        <p class="reveal-on-scroll will-change-transform">A winding roadmap flows between them, while a circle binds
          them in unity and resilience. Above it all, a leaf blooms — a quiet sign of renewal, growth, and future-minded
          care.</p>
        <p class="reveal-on-scroll will-change-transform">Just as myths inspired generations to find courage and
          guidance, Temani embodies this spirit today. We are not only a protector of knowledge, but also a companion
          who walks beside you, ensuring each decision is grounded in wisdom and each step forward builds confidence.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal-on-scroll will-change-transform">This story is more than heritage — it is our commitment.
          Technology may change, tools may evolve, but the principles of guidance, partnership, and resilience remain

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-[#005C6D] mb-6 reveal-on-scroll will-change-transform">The Origin of
        Temani</h2>
      <p class="text-base text-[#4a6970] mb-8 reveal-on-scroll will-change-transform">
        The name <span class="font-semibold">Temani</span> is more than a word—it’s a promise. In Indonesian,
        <em>temani</em> means “to accompany; keep someone company,” and comes from <em>teman</em> (“friend”).
        <br><br>
        We chose Temani because it captures the heart of our story: no one should have to walk the path of technology
        alone. From the first spark of an idea to the moment it becomes reality, we are there—guiding, supporting, and
        sharing every step.
        <br><br>
        Our brand is woven from symbols that reflect this journey. The dragon stands for wisdom and protection, the
        circle for continuity and care, the roadmap for clarity in complexity, the leaf for growth, and people for
        partnership. Together, they tell a story of resilience, trust, and progress—reminding us that technology is not
        just about tools, but about the people and relationships that shape it.
        <br><br>
        Temani is our invitation: let’s walk the path together.
